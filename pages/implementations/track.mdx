# __Track__
Represents a track 
## __Properties__

### __rawData__
Raw track data from the source node or provider.

### __track__
Encoded track string (`string`).

### __info__
Object containing all metadata about the track:

#### __Properties__
- `identifier: string`
- `seekable: boolean` — Whether the track is seekable.
- `author: string` — Track author or artist.
- `length: number` — Duration in milliseconds.
- `stream: boolean` — If the source is a stream/live.
- `position: number` (may be present) — Current playback position.
- `title: string` — Track title.
- `uri: string` — Track URL.
- `requester: any` — The requester object.
- `sourceName: string` — Platform/source eg. 'youtube', 'soundcloud', etc.
- `isrc: string | null` — ISRC code if available.
- `_cachedThumbnail: string | null` — Used internally; caches any fetched thumbnail data for speed.
- `thumbnail: string | null` — Computed property. Returns cached thumbnail, uses provider thumbnail/artwork when present, or attempts extraction using utility for v3/v4 as per node version.  Always prefer this for getting track artwork.
  - Logic prioritizes:
    1. Already cached value
    2. Provider thumbnail (eg. YouTube artwork url)
    3. For Lavalink v4: `artworkUrl` field
    4. If all else fails, uses helper (`getImageUrl(this)`) to dynamically construct a suitable fallback.

### __pluginInfo__
Raw plugin info object, if provided by backend.

## __Methods__

### __resolve(riffy)__
Attempts to resolve (find/correct) the best matching official version for this track using current author/title.
- **Parameters:**
  - `riffy`: Riffy instance—used for resolver function (`riffy.resolve`).
- **Returns:** `Promise<Track | undefined>`

- Matching logic:
  1. First, attempts to find an official audio track (matching author or author-topic and title) in search results.
  2. If not found, prefers duration-matched candidates (±2s).
  3. If still not found, prefers duration AND title match within tolerance.
  4. As a last fallback, accepts the first result of `riffy.resolve` search results.

```js copy
const found = await track.resolve(riffy);
if (found) {
  // found.track and found.info.* are now updated to best match
}
```

<Callout type="info">
The computed `thumbnail` is the safest way to obtain the best/final artwork, as it works across all sources (YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify/etc) and all supported Lavalink versions.
</Callout>
